The scope \n            of online management services is now no longer restricted to large corporate houses or \n            industries, but has spread across small business units as well. The advanced software \n            technology has also transformed the way the health industry worked in the earlier years.</p>\n          <p>A Clinic Management Software comes with a suite of features and functions that can assist \n            dental practitioners in many ways. The competent software allows the practitioner to manage \n            the clinic’s workflow by scheduling appointments, keeping a record of medicine stock, \n            invoice service bills, monitor revenues and even set automated reminder messages and emails.</p>\n          <h3>Here are the six reasons :</h3>\n\n          <h4>1)  Enhanced Productivity and Efficiency</h4>\n          <img src={blog_2} alt=\"\" className='blog-img'/>\n          <p>Clinic Management software improves the general efficiency of the clinic through streamlining \n            and automation of each process in the system. It has a fully functional system that includes \n            patient record management, appointment scheduler and rescheduler, appointment reminders, accounts \n            and inventory management, invoice and billing functions, referral tracker, and many more. \n            These advanced features enhance the response time to the demand of the patient's attention.</p>\n          <p>The automated process management brings down the operating cost of the clinic. It allows the \n              clinic staff to focus on more important tasks at hand, in turn increasing their productivity \n              and making their job more fulfilling.</p>\n\n\n          <h4>2)  Fast and Secure access to patient records – anytime, anywhere</h4>\n          <img src={blog_3} alt=\"\" className='blog-img'/>\n          <p>It's vital for clinics to be able to store, track, and retrieve patient’s records with ease. \n            With the clinic management software, clinics can easily record, update, and archive crucial \n            patient data, schedule of appointments, and revenue map within the system for hassle free access \n            at future encounters.</p>\n          <p>Apart from user friendly interface, security of patient information is another feature that \n            highly concerns clinics. The cloud-based clinic management software is highly secure as the \n            information is kept in encrypted format in compliance with industry’s security standards. \n            Since the records are digitized, it also makes retrieval of data lost due to unforeseen \n            circumstances easy and efficient.</p>\n\n          <h4>3)  Increased Accuracy and customer satisfaction</h4>\n          <img src={blog_4} alt=\"\" className='blog-img'/>\n          <p>When a patient record is stored manually, data mix up is bound to happen. Electronically \n            managed records are error-free. The chances of making mistakes gets reduced as all tasks \n            are automated.</p>\n          <p>For instance, appointment confirmations are automatically updated with additional auto e-mail \n            and SMS confirmation tools. The automated appointment reminders help the patient and the \n            practitioner for timely treatment and reduces the chance of missing an appointment.</p>\n          <p>The clinic management software also allows customized patient records according to the \n            medical history and needs of the patient. Thus, practitioners have a clear overview of \n            all aspects of the past and present patient ailments, making it easier to provide apt \n            treatment and medical services.</p>\n\n          <h4>4)  Eliminate Paperwork</h4>\n          <img src={blog_5} alt=\"\" className='blog-img'/>\n          <p>The basic advantage of using a clinic management software is that it helps to get rid \n            of all the manual paperwork. Paper based records are not only difficult to store and \n            maintain, but also prone to wear and tear.</p>\n          <p>With clinic management software, patient information along with their medical history \n            is stored in a well-organized and in an electronic format. The information stored is \n            legitimate and accurate, allowing the practitioner to spend less time in documentation \n            and more time on patient care.</p>\n\n          <h4>5)  Smart Billing System</h4>\n          <img src={blog_6} alt=\"\" className='blog-img'/>\n          <p>The robust billing module of clinic management software handles large numbers of patients \n            efficiently by minimizing delays and reducing the time taken to settle the bill. It also handles \n            complex mapping of insurance to eligible clients thereby eliminating errors and confusion in billing.</p>\n\n          <h4>6)  Easily Monitor Clinic’s performance</h4>\n          <img src={blog_7} alt=\"\" className='blog-img'/>\n          <p>One of the problems faced by many clinics due to the lack of a smart clinic management system is \n             tracking clinic performance and forecasting growth efficiently. The clinic management software gives \n             easy access to financial, operational, inventory, clinical, and treatment based reports available in \n             custom formats. Clinics can get spectacular insights from the reports, helping them to track the \n             important metrics accordingly and simulate strategies to maximize revenue.</p>\n\n          <p>\n            To sum up, Clinic Management Software is the need of the hour. Medical facilities, clinics, and hospitals \n            in India are fast relinquishing the traditional method of daily operations to switch to smarter and efficient \n            Clinic Management Software. It simplifies the workload of clinic staff and doctors as well as improves the \n            business process between staff, doctors, and patients.\n          </p>\n\n        </Article>\n        <Footer />\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}","\nfunction Error() {\n    return (\n      <div>The error page of the dentostack</div>\n    );\n  }\n  \n  export default Error;\n  ","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport { Route, Switch } from 'react-router';\n\n// Pages\nimport Home from './pages/Home';\nimport About from './pages/About';\nimport Privacy from './pages/Privacy';\nimport Blog from './pages/Blog';\nimport Error from './pages/Error';\n\nexport default class App extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n    <Switch>\n      <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home} />\n      <Route exact path=\"/about\" component={About} />\n      <Route exact path=\"/privacy\" component={Privacy} />\n      <Route path=\"/blog\" component={Blog} />\n      <Route path=\"/six-reasons-why\" component={Blog} />\n      <Route exact path=\"/start\" render={() => window.location = \"https://et0toe0vlt9.typeform.com/to/tsez9BEf\"} />\n      <Route component={Error} />\n    </Switch>\n    );\n  }\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport App from './App';\n//import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router } from \"react-router-dom\"\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <Router>\n    <React.StrictMode>\n      <App />\n    </React.StrictMode>\n  </Router>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
